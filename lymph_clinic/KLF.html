        <h3 class="headers-styling">What is Lymph Flow?</h3>
            
        <p>Lymphatic drainage therapy stimulates the lymphatic system, helping to remove toxins, reduce fluid retention, and boost your immune system. 
            This therapy is particularly beneficial for individuals recovering from surgery, experiencing lymphedema, or simply seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.</p>
       
            <p>At Lymph Flow, our focus is on supporting your well-being through gentle and effective manual techniques. 
                While our treatments can aid in relaxation and the promotion of a healthy lymphatic flow, they do not replace medical examinations or treatments by licensed healthcare professionals.</p>
            
            <p>If your doctor recommends lymphatic drainage and issues a Verordnung (ärztliche Anordnung), 
                you are welcome to bring it to us—we are happy to support your recovery within the scope of that referral.</p>
